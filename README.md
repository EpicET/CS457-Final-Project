# Application Review with Naive Bayes 

## Overview
There is a baseline and Naive Bayes model that test the effectiveness of using languages models to review applications.

## Setting up environment
We used a conda environment for this project. So first is installing conda to your computer.

Then create a conda environment with: conda create --name myenv. myenv is where you put the name of your conda environment.(optionally you specifiy the version of python by doing conda create --name myenv python=3.8).
Use conda activate myenv to enter your environment.

Next step is to make sure all the necessary libraries are installed in the environment. To install a library, use conda install library. The python interpreter should warn you if any missing libraries.

If you want to update any files, use conda update library. 

## Run code
Before running the code make sure to adjust file path so that it access the correct data file. 

To run Naives Bayes model you can use a run button at the top right or use the specified launch.json to run the current file. The baseline model is called within the Naive Bayes file so it will be run too.
